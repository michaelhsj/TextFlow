## Getting started

### Installing dependencies

**Option 1: uv**

Ensure [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is installed following their [official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Create a virtual environment, and install the required dependencies using _sync_:

```bash
uv sync
```

Then, activate the virtual environment:

| OS | Command |
| --- | --- |
| MacOS | ```source .venv/bin/activate``` |
| Windows | ```.venv\Scripts\activate``` |

**Option 2: pip**

Install the python dependencies with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Then activate the virtual environment:

| OS | Command |
| --- | --- |
| MacOS | ```source .venv/bin/activate``` |
| Windows | ```.venv\Scripts\activate``` |

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running Dagster

Start the Dagster UI web server:

```bash
dg dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the project.

## GPU job runner

In production, Dagster offloads heavy work to the optional `textflow-gpu-runner` instance by launching containers on its Docker engine. When you apply Terraform with `enable_gpu_job_runner=true`, the runner exposes its daemon over `tcp://textflow-gpu-runner:2375` and stores datasets under `/opt/textflow/datasets`. The webserver reads `DAGSTER_JOB_IMAGE` (default `textflow-jobs/pipeline:latest`) to decide which image to run remotely. Make sure that image is published (see `deployment/jobs`) before triggering runs from the UI.
